NFTs will not appear or display correctly for a number of reasons including:

- slow or down IPFS gateways
- unusual metadata formats and not using common property names e.g. name, image, description
- broken metadata and/or media (image, video) links
- dead or broken sites e.g. expired SSL certificates
