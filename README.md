NFT Looker is a simple application to view a wallet's NFTs on the Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom networks. You can put in an address, and then click through to the NFT or collection individually for more information. You can also connect your wallet with MetaMask for its address to be used for a lookup.

Compatible with ENS and Unstoppable Domains.

Images and videos are supported.

Further updates could include:

- more analytics e.g. date NFT was transferred to a wallet, how much it was purchased for, current NFT price based on marketplace data

Initially built for the Road to Web 3 ETHGlobal hackathon.
